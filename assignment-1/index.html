            Different organizations from around the world join the World Wide Web Consortium
            as members. These members work together to help guide the development of important
            web technologies and share ideas with people from research and industry. A few
            member organization logos are shown below and they change from time to time.

            The Web Consortium and its members also work closely with the public and the web
            community. They focus on different business areas that are influenced by the web,
            such as
            <a href="#">E-commerce</a>,
            <a href="#">Media & Entertainment</a>,
            <a href="#">Publishing</a>
            and many other fields.
